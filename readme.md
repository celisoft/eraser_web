Eraser is a ludum dare game (LD32) created in 72 hours. This version is made with PhaserJS instead of the original game which was created with C++ and SDL2 libs.

The original LD32 version is available [there](https://github.com/celisoft/ld32_eraser).

The goal of the game is to access the exit in less than 15 seconds by using your eraser as a weapon or as progress helper.
